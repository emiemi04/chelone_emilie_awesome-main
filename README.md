# CHÉLONÉ_Émilie_awesome

Welcome on my portfolio. It's written in French (english version in progress). 

You'll find projects that I did during my years of formation in Reunion Island's IUT.

I studied Network and Telecommunications, so you're mainly going to find network and cybersecurity purposes.

This website was made 100% by me.
